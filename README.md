# ImLazy backend API

ImLazy was at the beggining only a Node.js bot using Puppeteer module to invite workaway members in the area to meetup.
Then it evolved with a ReactJs UI and now taking a "SAAS template" form. (auth, user management...)

This project correspond to the backend API for the [**ImLazy** app frontend](https://github.com/baptistesx/im-lazy-frontend).
**Node.js** framework is used with **Express** module for the server.
**PostgreSQL** is used for the database.

## 1: Setup PostgreSQL

> **TODO:** To fill up this part
- To fill up the db

## 2: Setup project

- ### `git clone git@github.com:baptistesx/workaway-messaging.git`
- ### `cd workaway-messaging`
- Ask for .env file to Baptiste
- Replace .env.dist with .env received
- ### `npm i`
- # `npm start`

## Various TODOs

- Setup error handler and backend logs save in file
- Use Types for variables
- To check to use Sequilize and/or Knex for an easier use of models and db
